Crappy program to convert infix/postfix/prefix strings to their counterparts. Not really done yet so don't hold your breath. The program can convert strings from an input file (reading line-by-line) or via the `stdin`. Up to you.

Usage
-----

### Compiling

Super easy:

    gcc expr.c -o <output filename>

e.g.

    gcc expr.c -o expr

### Running

Even easier:

    ./<output filename>

e.g.

    ./expr
